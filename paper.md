# Summary
Random forests [@breiman2001random] are a popular class of supervised learning
models that have demonstrated impressive empirical success across a wide variety
of problems. The predictive accuracy of random forests stems from their ability
to learn high-order, non-linear interactions in large datasets. Although
approaches exist for evaluating the importance of individual features in a
fitted random forest, identifying interactions that drive predictive accuracy
remains a challenge. This challenge is in large part due to the enourmous number
of interactions that must be considered (i.e. there are $O(p^s)$ possible
interactions of size $s$ among $p$ features) and the instability of random
forest decision paths.

The iterative Random Forest algorithm (iRF), and corresponding `iRF` R package,
take a step towards addressing these issues with a computationally tractable
approach to search for important interactions in a fitted random forest
[@basu2018iterative]. Our algorithm grows a series of feature weighted random
forests [@amaratunga2008enriched] to perform soft regularization on the model
based on predictive features. We then search for prevalent interactions in the
fitted random forest using a generalization of random intersection trees
[@shah2014random].  Finally, we assess the stability of recovered interactions
by repeating this search across random forests trained on bootstrap samples of
the data. The `iRF` R package combines these steps into a single workflow. It is
based on the source codes from the R packages `randomForest`
[@liaw2002classification] and `FSInteract` [@shah2014random]. A detailed
vignette is available on
[github](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sumbose/iRF/master/vignettes/vignette2.html).
