## iterative Random Forests (iRF)

The R package `iRF` implements iterative Random Forests, a method for iteratively growing ensemble of weighted decision trees, and detecting high-order feature interactions by analyzing feature usage on decision paths. This version uses source codes from the R package `randomForest` by Andy Liaw and Matthew Weiner and the original Fortran codes by Leo Breiman and Adele Cutler.

To download and install the package, use `devtools`:

```r 
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("https://github.com/karlkumbier/iRF2.0")
```

You can subsequently load the package with the usual R commands:

```r
library(iRF)
```
